## 🚀 Features v2.0: The "Sudo" Update

We've completely overhauled the engine in version 2.0. The geometry shapes are gone; the **Emoji-based chaos** is back!

* **⚔️ Epic Boss Battles**: Face off against the **Legacy Code Monstrosity** (⚠️) and the **Memory Leak Daemon** (💀). They dash, they summon firewalls, and they don't follow clean code principles.
* **⚡ Sudo Mode**: Pick up the Golden Thunderbolt to gain **ROOT ACCESS**. Your standard `git push` projectile transforms into a spread-shot `rm -rf` blast that wipes out everything on screen.
* **🛡️ Defense Matrix**: Equip the Shield (🛡️) to survive one fatal `NullPointerException`.
* **🎹 Combo System**: Chain kills to rack up multipliers and high scores.
* **📺 Retro Visuals**: Immersive CRT scanline filter and dynamic parallax background that reads like a hacker's terminal.

## 👾 The Bestiary (Enemies)

Know your enemy to survive the sprint:

* 🐛 **Bug**: The classic pest. Small, annoying, everywhere.
* 🔥 **Firewall**: Tall barrier. You can't jump over it; you must shoot it down.
* 🔒 **Deadlock**: Floating locks that try to freeze your progress.
* 💥 **Crash**: Fast-moving explosive runtime errors.
* TODO **TechDebt**: Massive blocks of code that hurt you if you touch them.
